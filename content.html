        <h2 style="color: blue;">Book Name:Introduction to Autonomous Robots</h2>
        <p style="color: black;">A comprehensive introduction to the field of autonomous robotics aimed at upper-level undergraduates and offering additional online resources.

            Textbooks that provide a broad algorithmic perspective on the mechanics and dynamics of robots almost unfailingly serve students at the graduate level. Introduction to Autonomous Robots offers a much-needed resource for teaching third- and fourth-year undergraduates the computational fundamentals behind the design and control of autonomous robots. The authors use a class-tested and accessible approach to present progressive, step-by-step development concepts, alongside a wide range of real-world examples and fundamental concepts in mechanisms, sensing and actuation, computation, and uncertainty. Throughout, the authors balance the impact of hardware (mechanism, sensor, actuator) and software (algorithms) in teaching robot autonomy.
            
            Rigorous and tested in the classroom, Introduction to Autonomous Robots is written for engineering and computer science undergraduates with a sophomore-level understanding of linear algebra, probability theory, trigonometry, and statistics. Coverage includes basic concepts in robotic mechanisms like locomotion and grasping, plus the resulting forces; operation principles of sensors and actuators; basic algorithms for vision and feature detection; and an introduction to artificial neural networks, including convolutional and recurrent variants. QR codes in the text guide readers to online lecture videos and animations. The book also features extensive appendices focusing on project-based curricula, pertinent areas of mathematics, backpropagation, writing a research paper, and other topics, and is accompanied by a growing library of exercises in an open-source, platform-independent simulation (Webots)

    <center><h2 style="color: blue;">Book Name:NeuroRobotics</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">An introduction to neurorobotics that presents approaches and design principles for developing intelligent autonomous systems grounded in biology and neuroscience.

        Neurorobotics is an interdisciplinary field that draws on artificial intelligence, cognitive sciences, computer science, engineering, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics. Because the brain is closely coupled to the body and situated in the environment, neurorobots—autonomous systems modeled after some aspect of the brain—offer a powerful tool for studying neural function and may also be a means for developing autonomous systems with intelligence that rivals that of biological organisms. This textbook introduces approaches and design principles for developing intelligent autonomous systems grounded in biology and neuroscience. It is written for anyone interested in learning about this topic and can be used in cognitive robotics courses for students in psychology, cognitive science, and computer science.
        
        Neurorobotics covers the background and foundations of the field, with information on early neurorobots, relevant principles of neuroscience, learning rules and mechanisms, and reinforcement learning and prediction; neurorobot design principles grounded in neuroscience and principles of neuroscience research; and examples of neurorobots for navigation, developmental robotics, and social robots, presented with the cognitive science and neuroscience background that inspired them. A supplementary website offers videos, robot simulations, and links to software repositories with neurorobot examples.</p></center>
        <center><h2 style="color: blue;">Book Name:Learning for Adaptive and Reactive Robot Control</h2>
            <p style="color: black;">Methods by which robots can learn control laws that enable real-time reactivity using dynamical systems; with applications and exercises.

                This book presents a wealth of machine learning techniques to make the control of robots more flexible and safe when interacting with humans. It introduces a set of control laws that enable reactivity using dynamical systems, a widely used method for solving motion-planning problems in robotics. These control approaches can replan in milliseconds to adapt to new environmental constraints and offer safe and compliant control of forces in contact. The techniques offer theoretical advantages, including convergence to a goal, nonpenetration of obstacles, and passivity. The coverage of learning begins with low-level control parameters and progresses to higher-level competencies composed of combinations of skills.
                
                Learning for Adaptive and Reactive Robot Control is designed for graduate-level courses in robotics, with chapters that proceed from fundamentals to more advanced content. Techniques covered include learning from demonstration, optimization, and reinforcement learning, and using dynamical systems in learning control laws, trajectory planning, and methods for compliant and force control.

                                        <p style="color: black;">A hands-on approach to understanding and building compilers.

                                            Compilers are notoriously some of the most difficult programs to teach and understand. Most books about compilers dedicate one chapter to each progressive stage, a structure that hides how language features motivate design choices. By contrast, this innovative textbook provides an incremental approach that allows students to write every single line of code themselves. Essentials of Compilation guides the reader in constructing their own compiler for a small but powerful programming language, adding complex language features as the book progresses. Jeremy Siek explains the essential concepts, algorithms, and data structures that underlie modern compilers and lays the groundwork for future study of advanced topics. Already in wide use by students and professionals alike, this rigorous but accessible book invites readers to learn by doing.
                                            
                                            • Deconstructs the challenge of compiler construction into bite-sized pieces
                                            • Enhances learning by connecting language features to compiler design choices
                                            • Develops understanding of how programs are mapped onto computer hardware
                                            • Learn-by-doing approach suitable for students and professionals
                                            • Proven in the classroom

                                            <center><h2 style="color: blue;">Book Name:Program Proofs</h2></center>
                                            <p style="color: black;">This comprehensive highly readable textbook teaches students how to formally reason about computer programs using an incremental approach and the verification-aware programming language Dafny.

                                                Program Proofs shows students what it means to write specifications for programs, what it means for programs to satisfy those specifications, and how to write proofs that connect specifications and programs. Writing with clarity and humor, K. Rustan M. Leino first provides an overview of the basic theory behind reasoning about programs. He then gradually builds up to complex concepts and applications, until students are facing real programs using objects, data structures, and non-trivial recursion. To emphasize the practical nature of program proofs, all material and examples use the verification-aware programming language Dafny, but no previous knowledge of Dafny is assumed.
                                                
                                                • Written in a highly readable and student-friendly style

                                                <p style="color: black;">A broad introduction to algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, introducing the underlying mathematical problem formulations and the algorithms for solving them.

                                                    Automated decision-making systems or decision-support systems—used in applications that range from aircraft collision avoidance to breast cancer screening—must be designed to account for various sources of uncertainty while carefully balancing multiple objectives. This textbook provides a broad introduction to algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, covering the underlying mathematical problem formulations and the algorithms for solving them.
                                                    
                                                    The book first addresses the problem of reasoning about uncertainty and objectives in simple decisions at a single point in time, and then turns to sequential decision problems in stochastic environments where the outcomes of our actions are uncertain. It goes on to address model uncertainty, when we do not start with a known model and must learn how to act through interaction with the environment; state uncertainty, in which we do not know the current state of the environment due to imperfect perceptual information; and decision contexts involving multiple agents. The book focuses primarily on planning and reinforcement learning, although some of the techniques presented draw on elements of supervised learning and optimization. Algorithms are implemented in the Julia programming language. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the various approaches presented.</p>
